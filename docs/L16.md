# L16 - User Prompts Log

This document contains all the prompts given during the development of the overlapping data groups visualization with K-means clustering.

## Prompt 1
write a requirements document (in L12.md) for a python program that generates 3 groups of 2D data points, each with 2000 points, where the 3 groups have an overlap of 20% of the data points. Use NumPy and plot the points.

implement L12.md in python.

## Prompt 2
put it in main.py

## Prompt 3
remove the chart that shows the overlapping points

## Prompt 4
good job, but I'd like the points to keep their original color, and in addition, each point should be circled with a the color of the cluster.

## Prompt 5
add a button that when pressed, calculates k-means for the data points using K=3 and stop after 5 iterations.

## Prompt 6
when i click close to a cluster's centroid, i'd like you to scatter the points randomly on the plane.

## Prompt 7
i'd like you to only scatter the points of the cluster on which its centroid i clicked.

## Prompt 8
take all the prompts i gave you, and write them down to L16.md

## Prompt 9
now, please remove the circle around each scattered point.
