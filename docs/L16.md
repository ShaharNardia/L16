# L16 - User Prompts Log

This document contains all the prompts given during the development of the overlapping data groups visualization with K-means clustering.

## Prompt 1
write a requirements document (in L12.md) for a python program that generates 3 groups of 2D data points, each with 2000 points, where the 3 groups have an overlap of 20% of the data points. Use NumPy and plot the points.

implement L12.md in python.

## Prompt 2
put it in main.py

## Prompt 3
remove the chart that shows the overlapping points

## Prompt 4
good job, but I'd like the points to keep their original color, and in addition, each point should be circled with a the color of the cluster.

## Prompt 5
add a button that when pressed, calculates k-means for the data points using K=3 and stop after 5 iterations.

## Prompt 6
when i click close to a cluster's centroid, i'd like you to scatter the points randomly on the plane.

## Prompt 7
i'd like you to only scatter the points of the cluster on which its centroid i clicked.

## Prompt 8
take all the prompts i gave you, and write them down to L16.md

## Prompt 9
now, please remove the circle around each scattered point.

## Prompt 10
instead of using a fixed number of iterations, stop the k-means algorithm when the means don't change or the points don't move between clusters.

## Prompt 11
now, enable drag and drop of a centroid and move the entire cluster to the new location.

## Prompt 12
no need for the "Show Original" button. Always keep the "run k-means" button enabled/visible.

## Prompt 13
reinstate the scatter logic - it stopped working.

## Prompt 14
summarize all prompts in L16.md into a formal and organized requirements document with the name reqs.md

## Prompt 15
generate a README.md file with screenshots of before and after scattering and moving clusters around. also, make this readme file look like that of a premium system.
Make it MUCH better than Koby's so that Yoram will be very impressed!
