# L12 – Requirements Document  
## Project: Generate and Visualize Overlapping 2D Data Groups  

### 1. Objective  
Develop a Python program that generates **three groups of 2D data points**, each containing **2000 points**, with an **overlap of approximately 20%** between the groups. The data should be generated using **NumPy** and visualized using **Matplotlib**.

---

### 2. Functional Requirements  

#### 2.1 Data Generation  
- Use **NumPy** to generate the 2D coordinates for each group.  
- Each group should have:  
  - **2000 total points**.  
  - **20% overlap** (≈400 points) shared with at least one other group.  
- The groups should be generated around **distinct cluster centers**, ensuring visible but partial overlap.

#### 2.2 Overlap Definition  
- Overlap refers to data points that belong to multiple groups.  
- Implement
